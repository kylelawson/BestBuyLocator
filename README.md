# IT4785-BestBuyLocator
Android Prototype for Capella University IT4785 Best Buy Locator App

This is my project app for Capella University's IT4785 Mobile Development for Modern Devices 1 class. Over the course of the
class, we were to learn increasingly advanced topics of Android programming by developing a prototype app designed to ask for
input (a zip code and search radius) in order to define the search criteria for finding Best Buys, display the results in order
of increasing distance, and eventually show them on a map. 

I took the extra effort to make what could've been an assignment acceptable activity with a single screen to one with a modal
bottom sheet for input, a list view for search result display and used Google's map API. The basics of the app, such as UI
implementation via XML and onClickListeners were taught in the class, but the rest were something I felt I wanted to learn. 

Templates for some of the working parts are also available via my account. As I learn new ways to do things, I'll try to make
templates from them so that anyone can pull and use them without having to go through confusing tutorials that is often the
method of teaching programming. Learning by doing is great, but having a basic overview of what is happening is always missing.

Happy coding!
